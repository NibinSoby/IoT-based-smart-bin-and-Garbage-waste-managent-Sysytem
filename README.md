# IoT-based-smart-bin-and-Garbage-waste-managent-Sysytem
Todayâ€™s existing system, waste management authorities are wasting 100s of 1000s of dollars every day to manage the city waste, because most of the bins are either full to deliver or not even filling the waste. However, authority has to send vehicle and employees to each bin location. In addition to that, none of the government so far implement any of the IoT based waste management system widely. Here, we are going to develop an IoT based waste management which can save time as well as money; moreover, it is so practical to implement. Compare to existing system, IoT based smart bin that we are going implement has a lot more features. Firstly, it has motion sensor (Accelerometer) to prevent spilling out of waste liquid and other substance when the bin fall, it can be done by alerting to authorities when the bin fall down. Secondly, IR sensor detects the amount of waste in each waste bin, so that employees can ignore the unfilled or empty bin location when they go for collecting waste. This feature definitely designed for cost effective management. Another one significant feature that we are going add in this system is separating the waste based on the nature of the waste substances with the help of moisture sensor.
